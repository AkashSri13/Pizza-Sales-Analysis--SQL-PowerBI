### Pizza-Sales-Analysis

#### Project Overview:
In this comprehensive Data Analysis Project, I initiated with the data cleaning and exploration by using SQL to analyze data and finding the results as per client requirements. For the creation of dashboard used Microsoft Power BI tool where I have summarized the key values on the KPIâ€™s and used interactive charts in order to highlight Business Insights.

#### Business Problem:
A pizza company needs a robust and scalable data analytics solution to handle the vast amount of data(approximately 50k rows of data combined) to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights like trends, order patterns, menu performance, customer preferences and other key business metrics. Visualizations must also be created to identify trends and insights related to daily and monthly order volume, sales by pizza type and size, and top/bottom sellers. The end goal is to equip the business with data-driven insights that inform strategic decisions to improve operations and profitability.

#### Solution Plan:
In helping the pizza company gain valuable insights from their sales data CSV file, I will utilize SQL and data visualization with Power BI to extract relevant information and conduct insightful analyses. Data cleaning/processing, data transformation and analysis shall be done.
By leveraging SQL's functions, I can uncover key metrics like total revenue, average order size, and best/worst selling menu items.
Once the data has been extracted and prepared, I will leverage Power BI to present the findings through interactive visualizations. This will allow stakeholders at the pizza company to gain actionable insights into sales trends, order patterns, and menu performance through visually compelling charts, graphs, and reports.
I plan on creating a dynamic Power BI dashboard that enables users to explore details on daily order volume, sales by pizza type/size, or top/bottom selling items. The end goal is equipping the business with data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions that improve operations and profitability.

#### Key Points:
1)   Creation of a Database importing of data into database followed by the execution of SQL queries.
2)   Data cleaning and transformation of Datasets into Business tool
3)   DAX queries to calculate the Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total quantities, Total Selling of Pizzaâ€™s by categories/size and etc. have served during a year.
4)   Updating of new columns by modifying existing columns to get the accuracy in results
5)   Used KPIâ€™s ðŸ“‡ to analyze the key indicators for Pizza Sales Data.
6)   Used various charts ðŸ“Š for visualization of Pizza Sales Data to get into deep dive of Business performance
7)   Summarized the Pizza Sales data by comparing the results with the SQL queries to match the very much accuracy in the results.

#### Learning Outcome:
It has been an incredible experience to get into the deep dive of sales in business and to find out the results on the basis of clientâ€™s requirement. Microsoft Power Bi is an essential and an effective tool for any kind of business to gain insights, understanding of Business and forecasting.
